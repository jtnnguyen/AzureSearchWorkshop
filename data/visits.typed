Record,2a,2018-05-06T03:49:29.917Z,None known,Pain and swelling in the lower right leg.,"Father: MI at 72, hypertension, still living Mother: Colon cancer, hypertension, diabetes, still living","This is a 42 year old lady who travels frequently, has a history of melanoma, and h/o traumatic splenectomy who comes in today with a 4 day history of intermittent, stabbing pain in the right leg near the calf. On Friday she returned from a business trip in Ireland. On Saturday morning she was running when she fell and abraded her right lower leg. She thinks that she tripped, as this was early in the morning and it was dark. She cleaned the wound and applied Neosporin. The pain developed that day in her calf, in an area of the leg close to but not within the abraded area. She describes the pain as stabbing and sometimes throbbing, with a 3-5 pain rating on a scale of 1-10. It seems to be ameliorated by elevation, ice and Ibuprofen. The pain comes more frequently with walking, and has interfered with both her exercise and her work. It is also worse when she presses on the area. The pain is getting worse. She says the scraped area appears to be healing. She denies any feeling of tiredness, fever, chills, paresthesia, numbness and is able to walk on the leg. She also denies any chest pain or shortness of breath. swelling in the leg She has never been previously diagnosed with a blood clot. She is a smoker, 20 pack years. She is not on birth control. She has no history of hypertension. 12 years ago she had a splenectomy following an accident, and says she has had the vaccinations her doctor recommended. 10 years ago she had a melanoma of unknown stage removed from her left arm, and continues to follow up with her dermatologist.","Ms. X, who was very reliable","1.

Pneumonia at 7 years old","Lipitor, for high cholesterol Multivitamin Baby aspirin every day",Ms. X,"Vital Signs: BP 124/66, HR 88, RR 12, Temp. 37.3 C General: Pleasant and intelligent 42 year old female in no immediate distress Skin: There is an area of abrasion on the right lower leg, no erythema over painful area Lymph Nodes: There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy Musculoskeletal: The right leg is swollen about 1 cm more than the left leg. Positive Homans’sign. Problem List: 1. Painful lower right leg 2. Abraded lower right leg 3. Melanoma 4. High cholesterol, controlled with Lipitor 5. Smoking 6. Splenectomy 7. History of melanoma 8. Familial History of Colon Cancer Differential Diagnosis: 1. Deep Vein Thrombosis: This patient’s history of smoking, recent stasis with travel and a possibility of cancer recurrence make DVT a possible diagnosis. DVT is also the most immediately fatal possibility, and so it must be considered first. It is not the DVT itself that is dangerous, for there is usually enough compensating veins to return the blood eventually, but rather the pulmonary embolism that can result when a DVT moves from its original position. 5-20% of Calf DVTs progress to pulmonary embolism, and 20-30% progress to the thigh, which increases the chances of pulmonary embolism to 50%1. According to Harrison’s Principle of Internal Medicine, a DVT in the calf is difficult to diagnosis from physical examination alone. Symptoms may include “calf pain... posterior calf tenderness, warmth, increased tissue turgor or modest swelling... Homans’ sign is an unreliable diagnostic sign.”2 By Wells' Pretest Probability criteria of suspected Deep Vein Thrombosis, this patient has a score of -2, giving her a Low pretest probability. Even if she does have an undiagnosed active cancer, her score would be in the same probability with a score of -1. Therefore, a negative ultrasound of the area is enough to rule out a DVT. In addition, a D- Dimer result of less than 200 to 500 ng/mL with a Low Wells score has a 99% negative predictive value for ruling out DVT. However, these scores were developed in secondary care centers, and patients presenting to primary care have a higher rate of missed DVT. 3 Therefore, an ultrasound should be done, regardless of the D-Dimer score. 2. Stress Fracture of the Tibia: Many of the patient’s symptoms are suggestive of a stress fracture: she has a sharp, localized pain and tenderness, some swelling without erythema, and the pain is exacerbated with walking. Stress fractures often occur in athletes such as runners from overuse, but other causes can include poor footwear, running on uneven terrain, and nutrition problems such as anorexia and osteoporosis. An x-ray could confirm a stress fracture, but confirmation occurs less than 50% of the time in the first two weeks following the injury. Mild stress fractures are treated with elevation and ice, and switching or avoiding the exercise that caused the fracture for 6 weeks. 4 3. Muscle Strain: It is possible that this lady has pulled a muscle in her leg. Diagnosis of a muscle injury when there is no restriction in movement is difficult, and the treatment is the same as for a stress fracture. 4. Cellulitis: Cellulitis in a lower limb is always a differential diagnosis for DVT. I think an infection of the skin is unlikely in this patient because there is no erythema, local lymphadenopathy, abscesses or lesions. Also the pain is coming from deep in the leg, not the upper skin and fat layer. Her history of splenectomy makes the possibility of infection by encapsulated bacteria worrisome, but at this point her symptoms suggest a different diagnosis.5 5. Ruptured Baker’s Cyst: A Baker’s cyst is a popliteal bursitis that results from overuse of the knee. This patient has no history suggestive of a Baker’s Cyst, since there was no pain, swelling, or movement restriction of the knee prior to her fall. A ruptured Baker’s Cyst can result in pain in the posterior calf muscles, and treatment is directed to the underlying cause or disease."," Diagnostic: I recommend immediate duplex venous ultrasonography of her right lower leg. The sensitivity of this test for calf DVT is 75%. I would not do a D-Dimer test, since both a positive and a negative D-Dimer will lead to an ultrasound as the next step. Her pre-test probability of DVT is low, so provided the D-Dimer test is negative, I would Therapeutic plan: advise this patient to continue to let the leg rest as she has been doing, with elevation and ice. An x-ray for a stress fracture of the tibia is positive less than 50% of the time in the first two weeks following an injury, so I would get an x-ray but treat even if negative. If a stress fracture is diagnosed, we would need to talk about footwear, proper running technique, nutrition, etc. Crutches might be helpful if walking continues to be a problem. She may return to work provided she not doing any strenuous activity      while there. If she noted any changes in the pain or in the wound, I would advise her to come back in for further examination. If she has any shortness of breath, she should go immediately to the emergency room. Patient Education: Move around more when flying to avoid DVT","The patient is a single, never married, woman who lives alone. She is the vice president of a small pharmaceutical company, a job that has involved travel to Europe, Africa and Asia within the last year. She smokes 1 pack of cigarettes a day, 20- pack year, and drinks alcohol 2-3 times a week.",,,,,,,,

She does not know of any diseases that run in the family, gastrointestinal or otherwise.","This is a 43 year old Malaysian-American female with a medical history significant for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 2002. Since the birth of her second child in 1992, she has had periodic episodes of abdominal pain with or without N/V about every 6-24 months, usually localized to the RUQ. Most of these episodes have resolved spontaneously without medical care, but she has sought medical care on several of these occasions. In August of 2002, she underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Following this operation, she continued to have periodic abdominal pain, of the same character and at the same frequency as what she had been experiencing before her operation. She presents with her latest of these episodes. She had been in her usual state of health, until she woke up on Tuesday (4/12) morning with a constant, pinching abdominal pain localized to the right upper and middle upper abdomen. She also felt nauseous, but did not vomit. This pain got worse with intake of food, and seemed to improve after several hours of not eating. By Wednesday morning, her symptoms had mostly resolved, but she continued to feel some mild abdominal discomfort. This mild discomfort continued until Saturday morning, when she began to feel significantly worse. Her abdominal pain increased significantly (10/10) and she began to vomit everything she ate. By Saturday afternoon, she became diaphoretic and her pain continued to increase. She took a Kroger’s antacid Saturday evening, but otherwise did not do anything to treat these symptoms herself. She presented to the Duke ED early Sunday morning, where care was initiated and the patient was admitted to the Gen Med 4 service. She denies having chest pain, dyspnea, fevers, chills, back pain, and diarrhea at any point during this episode. Her most recent bowel movement was Saturday evening, and it was dark brown in color.","1) Patient and husband - good reliability, fair insight 2) Records from Durham Regional Hospital","1) s/p laparoscopic cholecystectomy, August 2002, DRH, pathology showed chronic cholecystitis       2) Occasional RUQ pain , +/- N/V, every 6-24 months since 1992, as described in HPI 3) Upper endoscopy in October 2002 at DRH for epigastric pain w/ normal LFTs showed mild gastritis, but unable to explain the patient’s symptoms 4) Upper endoscopy in Malaysia, date, indication and results not available 5) s/p tubal ligation, 1992 6) biopsy of endocervical polyp in 2003, showed benign columnar endocervical epithelium","Patient does not take any regular medication.

Extremities – Patellar reflex 2+ bilaterally.","1) Acute Cholangitis This patient has choledocolithiasis, with at least two stones present in the biliary tree – one in the common bile duct and one in the left hepatic duct. She also has several signs of acute infection of the biliary tree, including an elevated white blood cell count with a left shift, fever, and RUQ pain and tenderness. The notably absent signs of acute cholangitis are jaundice, bilirubinemia, and elevated alkaline phosphatase. The absence of these signs does not rule out acute cholangitis, and neither does the fact that only two out of three of the signs in Charcot’s Triad are present. In fact, Charcot’s Triad is only present in 50 to 75 percent of patients with acute cholangitis (Am J Surg 1975; 130:143). The absence of jaundice, bilirubinemia, and evlevated alkaline phosphatase suggests that either (1) the common bile duct is not completely obstructed, but is just causing sufficient obstruction to allow for stasis and an ascending bacterial infection, or (2) the stone in the common bile duct is not causing stasis at all, and the patient’s symptoms are caused entirely by the stone in the left hepatic duct. If only the left hepatic duct is blocked, these signs of stasis would be absent because drainage of bile down the right hepatic duct into the common hepatic duct and eventually into the duodenum would be unobstructed, and bilirubin could be cleared from the blood entirely by this route. It is also known that this patient’s biliary obstruction does not involve her pancreas, since she has normal serum lipase and amylase levels. The diagnosis of acute cholangitis is also strengthened by the fact that acute cholecystitis, which would otherwise be a leading differential diagnosis in this clinical picture, is impossible since this patient’s gallbladder is surgically absent. This diagnosis  of acute cholangitis will be confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Initial management of this patient is to treat her ascending infectious cholangitis with Unasyn (3 g IV q6h), and to fluid resuscitate her. Unasyn is an appropriate choice of antibiotics because it covers the leading seven species associated with nonmalignant cholangitis - Escherichia coli 43%, Klebsiella species 31%, Enterococcus 36%, Streptococcus species 24%, Bacteroides species 17%, and Enterobacter species 17%, and Citrobacter species 17%) (Surg Gynecol Obstet 171:275-282, 1990). Unasyn does not cover the eighth leading cause of nonmalignant cholangitis, which is Pseudomonas species (12%). If the patient had appeared to be septic at presentation (i.e. if she was hypotensive) or if her condition worsens once antibiotic therapy is initiated, providing coverage of Pseudomonas with an agent such as Zosyn (or Cipro and Flagyl) would be considered. More definitive treatment of the patient’s biliary obstruction will be sought at the time of ERCP. At this time, she will likely undergo a sphincterotomy, extraction of the CBD stone, and stent placement. It is unlikely that the stone in the left bile duct will be able to be extracted at the time of ERCP. If this stone does not pass spontaneously and the patient’s symptoms persist, it is likely that shock wave lithotripsy or surgical removal or the stone in the left hepatic duct will become necessary. The patient is being kept NPO and will not be kept off of heparin or NSAIDS to prevent a GI bleed from being initiated by the ERCP. In addition to treating her acute cholecystitis, this patient gives a history that suggests that she has subclinical, but still significantly symptomatic cases of acute cholangitis about once a year. Even though these cases usually resolve spontaneously (presumably by spontaneous passage of the gall stones) it is important to find the underlying cause that predisposes her to frequent choledocolithiasis. Choledocolithiasis generally does no occur in patients without gallbladders, so potential causes of stasis that could allow for a stone to nucleate and grow within the biliary tree will be evaluated. Such potential causes of stasis include cholengiocarcinoma, Mirizzi’s syndrome, Caroli’s disease, biliary strictures, and oriental cholangiohepatitis. The patent’s fasting serum cholesterol level will also be taken, because extreme hyperlipidemia can also predispose to frequent choledocolithiasis, so this must be ruled out as a cause of this patient’s frequent cholangitis. Given this patient’s history of growing up in Southeast Asia (Malaysia), oriental cholangiohepatitis is a very likely cause of her frequent choledocolithiasis. After removal of the stone in the patient’s CBD, a retrograde colangiogram should be taken. If this cholangiogram shows a strictured and/or fistulized CBD, the diagnosis of oriental cholangiahepatitis would be almost certain. Further supporting this diagnosis is the location of the stone in the patients left hepatic duct, as is frequently seen in patients with oriental cholangiohepatitis. If it is found that this patient does have oriental cholangiohepatitis, as is expected, the patient may desire an attempt at more definitive management by resection of the affected portion of the biliary tree. If surgical intervention is undertaken, the patient should also undergo a preoperative CT scan to evaluate for the possible benefit of left hepatic lobectomy. If she does not wish to undergo such an operation, regular surveillance with periodic removal of any stone is another successful management strategy. Finally, if analysis of the recovered stones show them to be composed of a large component of cholesterol (which is unlikely since cholesterol stones are typically radiolucent, and the at least one of this patient’s stones appears to be radioopaque, since it was seen on her chest radiograph) she was benefit from chronic ursodeoxycholic acid (UCDA) which is thought to have some efficacy in preventing the formation of cholesterol stones. This is also unlikely because most stones seen in patients with oriental cholangiohepatitis are composed of calcium bilirubinate. 2) Pain Management This patient was experiencing 10/10 pain at the time of her presentation, and it is important to treat this pain so that she is as comfortable as possible. Morphine and toradol gave her little relief in ED. Further, morphine is thought to cause contraction of the sphincter of Odis, which could worsen this patient’s symptoms and make ERCP more difficult. Her pain will therefore be treated with Dilaudid, 1mg IV q4h prn. 3) Hypokalemia This patient has a mild hypokalemia, which is most likely caused by the transcellular exchange of K+ for H+ to compensate for the non-anion gap metabolic alkalosis caused by vomiting. We will give patient NS with 20 meq KCl to replace this K+. 4) Hyperglycemia The patient was initially hyperglycemia on presentation, and has no history of diabetes. Her hypoglycemia is most likely a result of the general inflammatory state associated with her ascending cholangitis. It is also possible that she has previously undiagnosed diabetes. Her blood sugar became significant better controlled (at 116 and 92) after being given IVFs and Unasyn. This supports the theory that this patient’s hyperglycemia was being caused by her infection. Acute management of her hyperglycemia will be to monitor it with q6h Accuchecks and to treat it with sliding scale insulin as needed. Control of blood sugar is especially important in the setting of an infection since hyperglycemia can promote infection and worsen sepsis when it exists. We will also measure a hemoglobin A1C to rule out diabetes in this patient. 5) Abnormal Urinalysis This patient’s urinalysis showed 1+ protein, 2+ glucose, 3+ ketone, 1+ blood, 20 rbcs, and 8 wbcs. The glucose found in this patient’s urine was somewhat surprising since glucose is generally not found in urine until the plasma glucose exceeds 300, but this patient’s glucose was measured to be 256 on Chem7. The glucose found in her urine is best explained by the fact that her blood glucose may have been higher at some other point in time, such as immediately after she ate. Simliarly, the ketones found were somewhat surprising, but it is very likely that she had a mild ketosis as a result of her hyperglycemia. Having no eaten for several days probably lowered the glucose threshold above which ketones are produced. The blood is likely present in her urine since her patient is currently at the end of her menstrual period, and her urine sample could have easily been contaminated with some menstrual bleeding. There is no obvious explanation for the wbcs or protein found in this patient’s urine, unless she has a UTI or some other kidney disease. The patient does not currently have any urinary symptoms, and her creatinine is 0.6, so these abnormalities on urinalysis or not very concerning. Will repeat this urinalysis, and consider further workup if abnormalities persist. 6) Health Maintenance Will request medical records from PCP in morning during business hours. 7) Prophylaxis GI – 40 mg PO daily DVT – SCDs in place to LEs bilaterally 8) Code status This was not discussed with the patient, so she is a full code by default. 9) Disposition This patient will be discharged once the obstructions in her common bile duct have been addressed, the underlying cause of her choledocolithiasis has been investigated, and her symptoms have resolved. We anticipate this will take 2-4 days, but it may be longer if ERCP is unsuccessful","The patient was born in Malaysia, and lived there until her early 20s, when she moved to the United States with her husband. She grew up in a semi-rural area she frequently swam in the rivers. Her native language is Hokkien.

The average shishtocytosis in TTP is 8.45% (with a range of 1% to 18%); her shistocytosis was 5%. Her elevated LDH is also confirmatory of her shistocytosis. On her admission for TTP in 1996, her renal biopsy showed a thrombotic microangioma. Repeating renal biopsy would cause unnecessary morbidity in this case since the diagnosis is already quite certain. Thrombocyopenia, often with purpura – This patient does have a significant thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 66. In addition large platelets and clumping of platelets were noted on the peripheral blood smear, but of which are indicative of TTP. Some purpura were noted on physical exam, but they were not particularly prominent. Acute renal insufficiency that may be associated with anuria – This patient has acute renal failure, with a BUN of 119 and a creatinine of 13.6. She is oliguric (about 30 cc/hour), but not anuric. Neurologic abnormalities, usually fluctuating – The patient has several notable neurological abnormalities, but several of these seem to be present at baseline for her. The two abnormalities that the patient and her daughter acknowledge are new are her significant daytime somnolence and her headaches. Headache is the most common neurologic symptom found in TTP. Fever – The patient has been afebrile by history and has not had a fever in her first several hours in the hospital. The presence of four out of these five diagnostic criteria is very suggestive for a diagnosis of TTP. In fact, “fever” is the most commonly absent of the diagnostic pentad for TTP, especially in newer case series. It has even been suggested that fever may not be a symptom of TTP at all, but may be caused by complications of TTP, such as sepsis. Differential Diagnosis: The main other diagnosis to consider in this clinical picture is diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC). This diagnosis has been ruled out with a DIC screen that showed slightly elevated fibrinogen levels and undetectable levels of fragmented D-dimer. The presence of normal (or slightly above normal in this case) shows       that fibrinogen is not being consumed by DIC, and the absence of D-dimer also shows that the coagulation pathway is not actively taking place in this patient. Precipitating Factors: Most cases of TTP are idiopathic. In some cases, however, a single precipitating factor of TTP can found to be present. We will look for such a factor in this case, both to explain why the patient developed TTP and so that the precipitating factor can be treated. Potential precipitating factors include: Gastrointestinal infections, most commonly Shiga toxin-producing bacteria such as E. coli 0157:H7 – Fecal samples have been sent for fecal leukocytes, culture, fecal parasite screen, and C. dificil toxin. Drugs – The patient has not started any new drugs recently, and none of the drugs she is on are commonly known to precipitate TTP. Specifically, she does not take quinine or drink liquids high in quinine. Other drugs that are thought to precipitate TTP include cyclosporine, tacrolimus, OKT3, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, and valacyclovir. The patient is not on any of these agents. Antiphospholipid Antibodies – A screen for the antibody most commonly implicated antibody, anti-cardiolipin, has been sent and is pending. A screen for RBC IgG was negative HIV – HIV has been reported to precipitate TTP, so testing this patient for HIV will be considered. Cancer – Neoplastic processes can precipitate TTP, so once the patient is past the acute phase of her TTP, efforts will be made to improve her cancer screening, as well as her general health maintenance. Specifically, she should receive a colonoscopy, especially since she is guiac positive, and she should receive a mammogram since she has apparently not had one in several years. Pregnancy and Oral Contraceptives – The patient is not pregnant, nor does she take oral contraceptives or any other hormone therapy. Pneumococcal Infection – This patient does not have any signs or symptoms of pneumococcal infection. Treatment Treatment for TTP is plasmapheresis and administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). One randomized trial has shown this therapy to increase survival from 50% to 78% in patients with TTP (N Engl J Med 1991 Aug 8;325(6):393-7). A vascath has been placed in the patient’s femoral vein, and she will receive plasmapheresis once a day, along with daily administration of FFP. The rational behind this treatment is that plasmapheresis clears from the blood the anti-ADAMTS antibody, which causes ADAMTS13 deficiency and the resulting inability of the platelets to convert unusually large von Willebrand factor (ULVWf) to Von Willebrand factor (VWf). Transfusion of FFP helps to replete antibodies and other plasma proteins that are lost during the course of plasmapheresis. Anaphalaxic  and other anaphalactoid reactions occur commonly following transfusion of FFP, and are treated with epinephrine and corticosteroids when they occur. If plasmapheresis is not showing a measurable result within several days, IV corticosteroid therapy will be added to this therapy. Approximately 10-15 percent of patients do not respond to plasmapheresis. These patients are thought to have ADAMTS13 deficiency due to some cause other than anti-ADAMTS13 antibody. Administration of corticosteroid is of questionable efficacy in these patients, but it is currently the only therapy available. Since this patient showed a very good response to plasmapheresis and FFP transfusion on her last admission, it is expected that she will show a positive response again. 2) Acute Renal Failure This patient has acute renal failure, with a BUN of 119 and a creatinine of 13.6, on top of her preexisting chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine is 1.7). The cause of this renal failure is TTP, so it will be treated by treating the underlying TTP, as described above. In addition, the patient’s Lasix, Atenolol, and Norvasc are being held. These drug are being held both because they can impair renal function during episodes of acute renal failure, and because, in the setting of the large volume shifts associated with plasmaphoresis, they may complicate the clinical picture and make assessment of the patient’s fluid status more difficult. Norvasc will be restarted if the patient becomes significantly hypertensive, and lasix can be administered if she develops pulmonary edema. The patient currently has no indications for dialysis, but we will continue to monitor for these indications, such as acidemia, altered mental status, dangerous electrolyte abnormalities, volume overload, drug overdose, and symptomatic uremia. We will avoid giving patient any contrast dye as long as renal function is poor, and will take renal function into account when dosing medications. It is very posible that this patient’s renal function will never return to it’s baseline, and that she will suffer some permanent kidney damage as a result of this episode of TTP, just as she did during her last episode of TTP. 3) Anemia This patient is anemic, with a hematocrit of 0.34. This is a hemolytic anemia, and is caused by her TTP. Treatment of this anemia will be to treat its underlying cause – TTP. She will be transfused if her hematocrit continues to fall or if she begins to show increased symptoms of anemia. The patient’s type and screen will be kept up to date 4) Thrombocytopenia This patient is thrombocytopenic, with a platelet count of 66. This is caused by her TTP, so its treatment will be to treat the TTP. She currently has no acute bleeds, is hemodynamically stable, and has no indications for platelet transfusion. The patient’s Aspirin will be held during this hospitalization, because there is no need to inhibit the platelet function of a patient who is thrombocytopenic.     5) Diarrhea The patient’s diarrhea appears to be fairly mild, and it is not among her most significant complaints. It does not appear to be causing excessive volume loss or any electrolyte abnormalities. As described above, fecal samples have been sent for fecal leukocytes, culture, fecal parasite screen, and C. dificil toxin. If a treatable cause of her diarrhea is found, it will be treated appropriately. 6) Hypertenison The patient’s antihypertensives are currently being held to ensure adequate renal perfusion during her acute renal insufficiency. We will monitor the patient’s blood pressure, and will reinstitue antihypertensive therapy if she becomes more than moderately hypertensive. This is especially important in this patient since she has a history of a hypertensive stroke. 7) Elevated transaminasaes The patient has mildly elevated transaminases. Elevated transaminasaes are normally not associated with TTP, so this needs to be explained in some other way. A likely cause of these elevated levels is that the patient takes Lipitor. Her Lipitor will be held while she is in the hospital, because it may be complicating the clinical picture, and hypercholesterolemia is significantly less likely the cause morbidity or mortality while this patient is in the hospital than is her TTP. 8) Health maintenance The details of this patient’s health maintenance are currently unclear. Records will be obtained from her PCP. Once her TTP has been treated, follow up will be arranged with her PCP, and additional health screening will be encouraged. Specifically, she should receive a colonoscopy and a mammogram, as described above. 9) Prophylaxis GI – Protonix, 40 mg PO daily DVT – SVDs in place bilaterally. DVT is unlikely since the patient is thrombocytopenic. 10) Code status This has been discussed with the patient and she desires to be a full code. 11) Disposition The patient will need to stay in the hospital until this episode of TTP has resolved. We anticipate this will take approximately eight days, since her last episode of TTP resolved after eight days of therapy. TTP is however, a very serious disease with a significant mortality rate, so it is very possible that her TTP does not resolve quickly, or that other complications arise. It is also possible that her renal function will be significantly impaired after this hospitalization. Patient will most likely return to her home in Durham following discharge.",,,

For the past four days she has been using a borrowed wheelchair around her house due to the pain. It is worse with prolonged sitting or walking and relieved by leaning forward. It is typically an aching pain that becomes sharp with certain movement. The pain also occasionally radiates down her legs. She has a history of spinal stenosis and degenerative joint disease and reports a history of falls in the past as an initial cause of the pain. Lumbar x-rays and an MRI in WebCIS have shown the presence of severe spondylosis with central canal and foraminal narrowing related to degenerative changes. She is on a standing regimen 50mg of methadone daily for pain relief for her back. She also reports taking a single unknown dose of Demerol almost daily since her toe amputation for osteomyelitis on 11/14/07, but there is no record of this in WebCIS. She has previously been evaluated by spinal surgery by Dr. Mathur at the Orthopedic Spine Surgery clinic, but he has been hesitant about operating due to LH’s diabetes, which has recently been complicated with osteomyelitis, as well as her continued smoking. She has also undergone an epidural steroid infusion in 4/07. Shoulder pain: LH’s right shoulder has also been causing severe discomfort that has increased over the past several days. It is a constant aching pain that does not radiate into the arm or involve the neck. She has not noticed any changes in the range of motion, but does report pain with most movement. She also recently burned herself on the posterior right shoulder behind the AC joint after falling asleep on a heating pad, but this is healing well and she does not think it is the source of the pain. She has had prior x-rays available in WebCIS or her right shoulder that show degenerative changed and osteophytosis in her shoulder. Her pain control includes the methadone as discussed above as well as a lidoderm patch that she is currently worn on her left shoulder. She had been prescribed the patch for her left shoulder but started wearing it on the right after she burned her left shoulder. Sore throat: The patient also reports a two week history of sore throat and of seeing white pus in the back of her throat. She has a mild cough productive of clear sputum that has mostly subsided, but had not had any significant dyspnea. The cough is also associated with some left sided pain that she  indicates is approximately over the lateral aspect of the 10th rib space. She also reports a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit sometime last week, but denies other constitutional symptoms of night sweats or chills and is currently afebrile. She also denies dysphagia, drooling, nausea, vomiting, or excessive fatigue. She has not taken anything to specifically relieve the pain, and she believes it has been improving over the last few days. Diabetes mellitus: This was not discussed at length during this visit, but LH reports relatively good control of blood sugars recently with metformin 850mg tid. She has had feelings of “pins-and- needles” for a years now when she is resting, but she does not feel it has acutely worsened.

Right trapezius feels tight and is tender to palpation. Range of motion is full in both shoulders with some pain in the right shoulder with movement, most significantly with abduction. Palpation of lumbar vertebrae reveals exquisite tenderness. Back range of motion and leg raise tests were not performed due to significant patient discomfort.","Back pain: This has been a longstanding problem for LH, and spinal stenosis and foraminal narrowing related to degenerative disease is almost certainly the cause. Other causes of back pain such as strain or sprain about the lumbar vertebrae, vertebral fracture, neoplasm, infection, or referred pelvic pain have essentially been ruled out. Sprain and strain account for close to 70% of low back pain, but age-related degenerative changes, spinal stenosis, and disc herniation are the next most common causes, accounting collectively for about 17% of chronic low back pain (1). Given the chronicity and progression of LH’s disease as well as reasons discussed below, degenerative changes with stenosis and herniation are likely the cause of her pain. The duration of the symptoms and progressive worsening suggests a degenerative process as the cause of her back pain. Imaging studies including plain films of the lumbar spine and an MRI from 2/26/07 have confirmed severe narrowing of the spinal canal at multiple lumbar vertebrae as well as foraminal narrowing and disc herniation at multiple lumbar levels. Her clinical presentation correlates well with these findings as she reports very characteristic neurogenic claudication that is relieved quickly with rest or leaning forward. Neurogenic claudication has a reported sensitivity of 60-94% for lumbar spinal stenosis (2, 3). She also reports radiation of the pain down her legs, suggestion involvement of the lumbar nerve roots at the narrowed foramen. Nerve conduction studies confirmed multilevel radiculopathies at the lumbar vertebrae involving the paraspinous muscles, which would correlate with the clinical findings. MRI is 83-93% (4) and plain x-rays are about 60% sensitive (5) for spinal metastases so absence of evidence on these studies for LH makes this diagnosis unlikely. A full body bone scan on 12/11/07 also showed no evidence of metastatic disease affecting any bones. Infection is similarly ruled out due to the high combined sensitivity of MRI and x-ray to osteomyelitis in the lumbar vertebrae (4, 5). Referred pelvic or abdominal pain is also very unlikely given the lack of abdominal or pelvic pain reported in her recent history. Palpation of the pelvis and abdomen also fail to exacerbate the pain on physical exam, and there is no evidence of dysfunction of any pelvic or abdominal organs. Referred pain is an uncommon cause of chronic back pain, and LH’s history is much more characteristic of spinal pathology. Treatment at this time will be aimed at controlling LH’s pain. She has been on her methadone regimen for quite some time now and has a strong emotional and most likely physical reliance on it. She should continue taking methadone 20mg in the morning, 10mg at lunch, 10mg at dinner, and 10mg before bed. At this time we will also encourage her to start acetaminophen 650mg q6hrs to help with the pain and associated inflammation. NSAIDs will be avoided to prevent the possibility of increased cardiac risk (6) since she already has risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, and tobacco abuse. She also needs to stay ambulatory and a two-wheeled walker with a seat was prescribed to allow her to walk with some forward flexion. Hopefully, this will encourage her to continue walking and keep her lumbar spinal cavity as patent as possible to prevent compression and pain. The best long term intervention is somewhat uncertain. Spinal surgery for lumbar stenosis has been fairly well studied and outcomes for surgical vs. non-surgical treatment are not dramatically different. The Maine Lumbar Spine Study has followed 97 patients for 8-10 years in a prospective observational cohort study and both the surgical and non-surgical groups reported marked improvement over the treatment period. Only moderate advantages in leg pain relief and functional back status were seen in the group that initially chose surgery (7), but the risk of surgery includes a 0.5-2.3% mortality risk depending on patient profiles (8, 9). Repeat operations are also common at 20-25% (10, 11). Given LH’s high surgical risk due to a history of diabetes complicated by osteomyelitis, uncontrolled hypertension, and advanced age she is a poor surgical candidate, and Dr. Mathur would be reluctant to operate on her. At this point the moderate possible benefit gained would not be worth the risk of the operation in her case. Another epidural injection with a steroid and anesthetic may be helpful in the future is she wishes to undergo the procedure again. Only a few studies of fair quality have addressed this intervention for spinal stenosis, but initial results indicate a short term benefit in pain relief and functionality (12, 13). Physical therapy also appears to show some benefit in early investigations and may be considered for LH in the future (14). Summary of interventions today: 1. Start acetaminophen 650mg q6hrs 2. 2-wheeled walker with seat prescribed 3. Continue methadone 50mg daily Shoulder pain: Previous x-rays have shown severe degenerative joint disease with osteophytosis in her right shoulder, which correlates with her clinical complaints of pain with movement and conserved range of motion. There also appears to be some muscle spasm in the trapezius associated with the painful shoulder. She had moved the lidoderm patch to the opposite shoulder after burning her right shoulder with the heating pad so she has most likely had less pain control in that shoulder recently as a result. Now that the area is healing well she should move the patch back to her right shoulder. Starting acetaminophen and continuing methadone as described above should also help with pain control. Sore throat: LH is currently afebrile and the HEENT exam did not reveal signs of a bacterial pharyngitis such as tonisillar swelling or exudates. Physical exam and history also do not indicate pneumonia or other infection that would warrant antibiotic therapy. Given the recent improvement and time course of the complaint it is most likely a self-limiting upper respiratory tract infection that will not benefit significantly from any pharmacotherapy at this stage. She will contact the clinic if she develops high fevers, difficulty swallowing or breathing, or severe worsening of symptoms. Diabetes Mellitis: The problem appears to be stable, but was not addressed at length during this visit. No intervention was made today and she will follow-up with Dr. Aleman at her next visit for management. Depression: This problem appears to be stable. She can continue the celexa and buproprion and follow-up with Dr. Aleman at her next scheduled visit.","Patient has been smoking for 50 years and currently smokes 1pk/day. She denies alcohol use.

[Risk] increases steadily to age 50, after which it doubles with each decade” (Ruben, 608). Colon cancer is usually initially clinically silent and most commonly presents as hemoccult positive stools. However, large tumors can cause intestinal obstruction and associated constipation and abdominal pain. “A positive test result for fecal occult blood predicts the presence of a cancer or an adenoma in 50% of cases” (Ruben, 609). “Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States” (American Cancer Society). However, if detected early and at a low stage, surgery can be curative. Thus, at age 65, Mr. H is at risk for colorectal cancer. Furthermore, Mr. H’s bloody stools, hemoccult positive stool, weight loss, constipation, and abdominal pain are worrisome for cancer and possible intestinal obstruction by tumor. Therefore, based on this clinical presentation and the life-saving importance of early detection, Mr. H should first be evaluated for colon cancer by colonoscopy. Gastric and duodenal ulcers can also cause epigastric abdominal pain and bloody stools, secondary to gastric bleeding. “The symptoms of gastric and duodenal ulcers are similar...[both are] characterized by epigastric pain 1 to 3 hours after a meal, or that awakens the patient at night” (Ruben, 567). Heartburn, nausea, and weight loss can also occur with gastric and duodenal ulcers. Although Mr. H does not associate his abdominal pain with food or meals, his pain does wake him up at night. Furthermore, Mr. H’s abdominal pain onset 2 months after discontinuing Protonix, and he has experienced heartburn, nausea, bloody stools, and weight loss, all of which can be associated with gastric and duodenal ulcers. Therefore, gastric and duodenal ulcers should be considered next in the differential (Ruben, 567-568) Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can also cause epigastric abdominal pain. Based on the onset of Mr. H’s abdominal pain 2 months after discontinuing Protonix, and his symptoms of a lump in his throat, dysphagia, heartburn, and nausea, GERD should be considered next in the differential (Ruben, 553-555). Restarting Protonix therapy will decrease the amount of acid produced in Mr. H’s stomach and should alleviate symptoms resulting from gastric and duodenal ulcers and GERD. Therefore, if Mr. H’s abdominal pain is relieved with Protonix therapy, it can be attributed to one of these gastric-acid based conditions. Finally, intestinal obstruction secondary to chronic constipation should be considered as a possible contributing factor to Mr. H’s abdominal pain. While such an obstruction could explain Mr. H’s pain, it does not explain his worrisome symptoms of bloody stools or the finding of hemoccult positive stool and should therefore be considered in addition to another, more complete, explanation. Similarly, anxiety or depression related abdominal pain, abdominal aortic aneurysm, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer would not explain Mr. H’s bleeding and, like intestinal obstruction, should only be considered in addition to another, more complete, explanation. Diagnostic plan: Colonoscopy to evaluate the colon for presence of polyps or tumors Therapeutic plan: If colon cancer is detected on colonoscopy, refer Mr. H to a GI oncologist. Restart Protonix therapy Treat constipation with laxative as needed or daily Metamucil Patient Education: The importance of colonoscopy screening for colon cancer was discussed with the patient.

Possible causes of angioedema include allergic anaphylaxis reaction, drug induced, allergic contact dermatitis, viral infection, drug induced, or a C1 inhibitor deficiency disorder acquired or hereditary. Laryngeal edema can also be caused by tonsillitis, peritonsilar abscess or pharyngeal foreign body. It is unlikely that the patient has edema caused by abscess or tonsillitis since she does not have any associated fever or other signs of infection and the sudden onset of her swelling also argues against this. It is not likely a foreign body since ENT did not find anything when they scoped her. It is unlikely that it is caused by a mast cell mediated etiologigy that increases vascular permeability through mast cell degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators include allergic angioedema, autoimmune mast cell release and direct mast cell release caused by medications such as opiates and radiocontrast media. It is not likely this type of reaction because these etiologies are associated with urticaria and pruritis, which the patient did not have. Also the patient did not have any exposure to a new pet, food, lotion or any other allergen or medication that could cause an allergic type reaction. The patient also does not have any history of autoimmune disease or any reaction similar to this in the past It is more likely that the etiology is kinin-related where angioedema results from generation of bradykinin and complement-derived mediators that increase vascular permeability since there is no urticaria or pruritis. The most likely cause is the Altace (ACEI) that the patient has been taking caused an increase in bradykinin since it decreases angiotensin 2 which degrades bradykinin. Bradykinin can then interact with vascular receptors increasing vasodilation, vascular permeability, increased cGMP and release of nitric oxide. This reaction occurs in .1-7% of patients treated with an ACEI and it typically involves the mouth, lips, tounge, larynx, pharynx and sublottic tissues. Half of these cases usually occur within a week of starting the ACEI but can occur years later. This is a class specific reaction not a drug specific and ARBs can cause the same reaction even though these drugs don’t effect the kinin metabolism. 50% of patients with angioedema due to an ARB also had an ACEI induced angioedema (Cicardi, M, Zingale, LC, Bergamschini L, Agostoni, A. Angioedema associated with agniotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use: outcome after switching to a different treatment. Arch Intern Med 2004; 164:910). Deficiency of C1 inhibitor can cause angioedema since levels of complement are reduced and cause increased bradykinin. This can be due to lack of C1 INH or adequate amounts of nonfunctional C1 INH. Other causes of angioedema include aspirin and NSAIDs since inhibition of cox and enzyme pathyway increases formation of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes. Other possibilities in the differential of causes of swelling include cellulitis, autoimmune conditions including SLE, polymyositis, dermatomyositis and sjorgren’s syndrome. Hypothyroidism can cuase puffiness of face and lips, hyperthyroidism can cause an infiltrative dermopathy, superior vena cava syndrome and tumors can cause venous engorgement and swelling. It is not likely one of these etiologies since the patient is on  an ACEI and the swelling is restricted only to her tongue and throat typical of ACEI angioedema.",s/p vaginal wall operation for prolapse 2006 s/p Cardiac stent in 1999 s/p hystarectomy in 1970s s/p kidney stone retrieval 1960s,,

She stated that on Wednesday evening after being in her usual state of health she began to experience sharp lower abdominal pain that radiated throughout all four quadrants. The pain waxed and waned and was about a 4/10 and more intense than the chronic abdominal pain episodes she experiences periodically from her Crohn’s disease. The pain was sudden and she did not take any medications to alleviate the discomfort. The abdominal pain was quickly followed by two episodes of partial diarrhea and soft stool that was tan in color with no signs of blood. Her abdominal pain continued and she developed nausea and then vomited six times that evening before going to sleep. Overnight her abdominal pain worsened and she stayed in bed for most of the day on Thursday. She had nausea again all day but had no other episodes of diarrhea or vomiting that day and did not eat anything for fear of vomiting. She was able to drink water and keep it down. By late Thursday night, her pain had intensified to a 10/10 and she called 911 and was brought to the ER by ambulance from her home in Burlington. Ms. ___ also stated that she had just ended a three week course of prednisone four days ago, which she had started about a month ago at 60 mg and tapered herself down over a few days by 10 mg.

The pain was much more intense than the chronic pain she usually experiences with her Crohn’s disease. The differential diagnosis for her cluster of symptoms includes inflammatory bowel disease, specifically a Crohn’s disease exacerbation, intestinal obstruction, and mesenteric insufficiency or infarction. Ms. ___’s abdominal pain is most likely from a Crohn’s disease flare because of her presenting symptoms, radiological imaging findings, and history of these exacerbations that have resolved with the use of prednisone. Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory bowel disease condition of unknown etiology that can affect any part of the GI tract. Its primary characteristic is transmural inflammation that can affect the GI tract from mouth to anus and can result in severe abdominal pain, bleeding, ileitis, colitis, bowel perforation and fistula formation, and perianal abscesses. 80% of patients have small bowel involvement, including the distal ileum with possible sparing of the rectum. Patients with Crohn’s disease can be asymptomatic at times but when the disease is exacerbated, patients can present with weight loss, fever, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and anal bleeding. Crohn’s disease is diagnosed by colonoscopy and intestinal biopsy. Pathologically, Crohn’s disease is noted for its cobblestone appearance from polypoidy mucosal changes and focal areas of ulceration next to normal mucosa. Crohn’s differs from another inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis (UC) in that UC has a continuous area of inflammation to the level of the submucosa that begins at the rectum and works up backwards up the GI tract, rarely forms fistulas or perforations, and has a higher association with colon cancer. There are also extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn’s disease, including eye involvement (uveitis, iritis, and episcleritis), skin disorders (erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum), arthritis of large joints or sacroilitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, secondary amyloidosis, and venous or arterial thromboembolism. Ms. ___’s medical history indicates that she has debilitating knee arthritis and back pain and developed a DVT in 2001 that resulted in a PE. These other disease manifestations may be associated to her Crohn’s disease. As in Ms. ___’s case, abdominal imaging can detect active Crohn’s disease and its inflammatory process. Crohn’s disease can be treated with numerous medications that play primarily a role in immunosuppression. These medications in order of importance include 5- ASA drugs (sulfasalazine and mesalamine), steroids (prednisone or budesonide), immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate), immune modulators (infliximab, adalimumab) omega 3- acid supplements, and antibiotics when warranted. A combination of these medications can be used to control the disease and prevent Crohn’s exacerbation but corticosteroids have been found to give the most immediate relief from inflammation. For her Crohn's flare, Ms. ___ will start prednisone 60 mg and take the medication for two  weeks and then slowly taper herself every two weeks decreasing the dosage by 10 mg. The vomiting and diarrhea had resolved by admission and her nausea will be treated with phenegran if it persists. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate will also be obtained to see if there is an increase in inflammation and possible infection process. Ms. ___ will also continue taking her other medications for Crohn’s: mercaptopurine, mesalamine, and omega 3-acid supplement. A small bowel obstruction is also on the differential and occurs when the passage of normal GI contents is blocked. This usually occurs as a result of post-operative complications or hernias but can be due to masses, strictures, gastroparesis, or simply constipation. This ileus would present with abdominal pain and bloating, nausea, vomiting, and constipation, a reduced appetite due to a feeling of fullness, and abdominal distention. However, Ms. ___ was able to pass stool with the onset of her symptoms and was not constipated or abnormally distended, which would be expected in an intestinal obstruction. It is also unlikely that a small bowel obstruction would present with guaiac positive stool. Furthermore, while the abdominal XR did show dilated small bowel loops that are seen in a small bowel obstruction, the CT image better identified this as thickening of the terminal mucosal ileum, which is more suggestive of Crohn’s disease than a small bowel obstruction. Also, the acute nausea and vomiting resolved spontaneously by the time of admission. A small bowel obstruction can be a medical emergency and should be diagnosed quickly to prevent complications, such as ischemia and strangulation of intestines. Medical management for small bowel includes mobilizing the patient, discontinuing medications that may have reduced gut motility, enemas, decompression with NGT, rectal tubes, or colonoscopy, or operative procedure if the condition merits it.  Acute mesenteric ischemia of the small intestine is on the differential for Ms. ___’s abdominal pain. Mesenteric ischemia occurs when there is a reduction in arterial or venous intestinal blood flow due to an occlusion, vasospasm, and/or hypoperfusion of the mesenteric vasculature. Mesenteric ischemia can result in bowel infarction, sepsis, and is a medical emergency. The four major causes of acute mesenteric ischemia are superior mesenteric artery embolism or thrombosis, mesenteric venous thrombosis, and nonocclusive ischemia. Most mesenteric ischemia is of arterial origin. The patient usually presents with rapid onset of severe periumbilical abdominal pain that is out of proportion to physical exam findings in addition to nausea and vomiting. Sudden pain associated with minimal abdominal signs and forceful bowel evacuation increase the likelihood of mesenteric ischemia. Also, a state of metabolic acidosis and acute abdominal pain also suggest mesenteric ischemia. Ms. ___’s risk factors for mesenteric ischemia include hypercoagulability, specifically her DVT resulting in PE in 2001. Also, Ms. ___ has a history of small bowel obstruction, which can predispose an individual to hypoperfusion leading to ischemia. Mesenteric angiography is used to detect mesenteric ischemia and Doppler ultrasound can help visualize occlusions and stenoses of vessels. A CT scan can be helpful in detecting a mesenteric thrombosis. Labs to consider are lactic acid levels and CBC for leukocytosis and elevated hematocrit, even though these studies are nonspecific. While she experienced nausea and vomiting with her abdominal pain, Ms. ___’s abdominal pain is unlikely to be from acute mesenteric ischemia because of the duration of her abdominal pain, normal vital signs and physical exam that was not out of proportion in regards to her appearance.  #2 DM Ms. ___ is a diabetic and her glucose on admission was 91. Her glucose will be strictly monitored during her stay and her AIC will be checked. She has been on a combination of Sitalgliptin and metformin to treat her insulin resistance diabetes. Sitalgliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that improves glycemic control by increasing the amount of glucagon-like peptide -1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide secretion, leading to increased secretion of insulin and inhibition of glucagon secretion. Metformin is a biguanide that reduces hepatic glucose production, therefore also lowering glucotoxicity. We do not have this combination medication and will start Ms. ___ on sliding scale insulin to control her glucose levels. #3 HTN Ms. ___ has hypertension that appears to be well controlled on lisinopril. Her hypertension, DM, and physical inactivity are major cardiovascular risk factors and it is important to keep her blood pressure well-controlled under 130/80 to prevent end-organ damage and future cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We will continue her lisinopril as prescribed. #4 Nicotine dependence Ms. ___ has smoked at least half a pack of cigarettes for the past 30 years. Smoking toxins can exacerbate Crohn’s and cause more active episodes of inflammation. She will be counseled on the importance of smoking cessation and the effects it has on her cardiovascular and pulmonary health, risk of cancer development, and current Crohn’s disease condition. #5 chronic left knee and back pain Ms. ___ suffers from chronic pain from past injury to her back and arthritis in her knee. Inflammatory bowel disease has also been found to be associated with arthritis and this may be playing a role in Ms. ___’s arthritis in her joint and back causing inflammation and pain damaging supportive connective tissue. She has had this chronic condition for years and we will give her tramadol for pain if her discomfort increases or persists. #6 FEN Ms. ___ is diabetic and we will start her on diet that is restricted in sugars and fats while providing her with a daily balance of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats that will give her the essential nutrients she needs. We will monitor her electrolytes and hydrate with fluids if needed. #7 Bipolar Disorder Ms. ___ appears stable and does not exhibit symptoms of mania or depression. She has not recently had racing thoughts, flight of ideas, increased energy and less need for sleep, feelings of grandiosity and episodes of increased happiness and excitability or participation in unusual risk- taking behavior. Also she has not been depressed and has not had thoughts of suicide as she has had in the past. She appears stable and we will continue her psychiatric medication paliperidone. Paliperidone is an antipsychotic that is FDA approved for the treatment of schizophrenia but has been effective in stabilizing Ms. ___ reducing her episodes of mania and severe depression. #8 Prophylaxis Ms ___ is an obese woman who had a DVT and PE in 2001. Since she tends to remain in bed most of the time at home and in the hospital, SC heparin will be started as DVT prophylaxis. Heparin is an anticoagulant that will reduce the formation of venous thromboembolism in extremities to prevent a PE. Her aPTT will be monitored during her hospital stay to make sure that we are not increasing her risk of bleeding by prolonging bleeding time as would be indicated by an elevated aPTT, reflective of the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Ms. ___ also has a history of Peptic ulcer disease and we will give Nexium, a proton pump inhibitor, as prophylaxis for gastric and duodenal ulcer formation and bleed. #9 Disposition Ms. ___ is full code. We will continue all her home medications as prescribed while she is in the hospital.",,"Crohn's disease flare (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) Adenocarcinoma of terminal ileum, s/p resection 1998 hx of small bowel obstruction secondary to Crohn’s Disease DM HTN hx of DVT and PE, 2001 PUD GERD COPD Posttraumatic stress disorder Bipolar disorder hx of multiple suicide attempts insomnia chronic abdominal, back, and left knee pain osteoarthritis of knee joints use of cane for walking nicotine dependence and abuse hx of narcotic seeking behavior poor dentition without denture use exposure to crack cocaine and possible abuse or hx of abuse responsibility for care of dying relative obesity",

He works as a truck driver, and the symptoms began four days prior to admission, while he was in Jackson, MS. He drove from Jackson to Abilene, TX, the day after the symptoms began, where worsening of his dyspnea and pain prompted him to go to the emergency room. There, he was diagnosed with pneumonia and placed on Levaquin 500 mg daily and Benzonatate 200 mg TID, which he has been taking for two days with only slight improvement. He then drove from Abilene back to Greensboro, where he resides, and continued to experience shortness of breath, right sided chest pain, and hemoptysis. He presented to an urgent care office in town today, and was subsequently transferred to the Moses Cone ER due to the provider’s suspicion of PE. The right-sided pain is located midway down his ribcage, below the axilla. This pain is sharp, about 7/10 in severity, and worsens with movement and cough. Pressing on the chest does not recreate the pain. He feels that the pain has improved somewhat over the past two days. The hemoptysis has been unchanged since it began; there is not frank blood, but his sputum has been consistently blood-tinged. The blood seems redder at night. The dyspnea has been severe, and it is difficult for him to walk more than across a room. He states that he feels as though there is a “rattling” in his chest. At baseline, he experiences no dyspnea on exertion and has no history of COPD or other respiratory problem. He is a smoker, smoking a little less than a pack a day for thirty-five years. Past history is notable for the fact that he experienced transient left lower leg swelling – from below the knee down – and pain several weeks ago during a cross-country haul. He also notes a four day history of decreased appetite, poor sleep, and subjective fever and chills, with a measured fever of 103 in the hospital in Abilene. He had a bout of pneumonia about two months ago, but has been healthy for the most part and denies any chronic medical conditions. Currently he is fairly comfortable, with morphine helping with the pain. He has no history of a clotting disorder, no cardiac history, and denies any chest trauma or aspiration.

Shortness of breath: The symptoms of dyspnea, hemoptysis, and the right-sided chest pain could all be explained by a pulmonary embolus, and the CT shows evidence that confirms this diagnosis. Management should be to supply supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation, to control Mr.--’s chest pain, and to anticoagulate him. Anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin and Coumadin could be started simultaneously, with both therapies should overlapping for at least five days; we will seek to obtain an INR between 2 and 3. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, without evidence of right heart strain, so thrombolysis does not seem indicated at this time. With his history of long drives back and forth to California, Mr. -- is at risk for venous stasis, which is a major source of DVT’s; he even presents a history of lower leg pain and swelling. Testing for various causes of hypercoagulability would also be reasonable: these include deficiencies of proteins C and S, antithrombin III, lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin antibodies, and factor V mutations, prothrombin mutation, lipoprotein a, and hyperhomocystinemia. Another important factor to consider would be malignancy, especially as Mr. -- is a long-time smoker. Screening for lung, colon, and prostate cancer would be appropriate. 2. Possible pneumonia: Mr. -- has a history of being febrile, and was diagnosed with pneumonia in Abilene (obtaining these records will be helpful), but does not currently have an elevated white count. The CT demonstrates an infiltrate, possibly consistent with pneumonia. Sputum cultures and blood cultures would be reasonable to obtain, though since he has been taking an antibiotic for presumed community acquired pneumonia, this may be low-yield. His vitals should be monitored regularly. It is possible that all pulmonary symptoms stem from the pulmonary embolus, but it would be reasonable to continue the antibiotic therapy that he has already started in order to cover the possibility of an infectious component. 3. Anemia: Admission labs show hemoglobin at 11.5, with MCV of 89.5, so this anemia is normocytic. The patient denies any history of anemia when questioned, and was not dizzy, pale, or fatigued. He has had no history of acute blood loss other than the hemoptysis, which tends to be blood-tinged sputum rather than frank blood, and is not large in quantity. In order to work this up, we could obtain a reticulocyte level, a blood smear, TSH level, and test for occult blood in the stool. He has no history of renal problems, and his creatinine is 1.0. He has never had a colonoscopy, so this should be certainly pursued in the outpatient setting. 4. Smoking cessation: Mr. -- expressed interest in smoking cessation, and acknowledges that his respiratory symptoms make him feel less interested in smoking. I counseled him that this would be an excellent time to quit, as he will be in a structured environment without easy access to cigarettes. We can support his cessation attempt by providing a nicotine patch or other supplement as needed for cravings, and by requesting a smoking cessation consult. He has a great deal of family support from his brother and daughter in this pursuit.",,1. Pulmonary embolus 2. Possible pneumonia 3. Anemia 4. Smoking cessation,

DDx is currently NMS vs infection, namely aspiration pneumonia. Mr. –‘s condition fits the typical clinical picture or NMS: recent mental status change (he was hospitalized on 11-16 for aggressive behavior and trying to defecate in the day room at Carolina Meadows), muscular rigidity (cogwheeling noted on exam), hyperthermia (his fever peaked at 40.4 just before Dantrolene was hung), and autonomic instability (tachycardia up to 131, HTN up to153/81, RR as high as 24, and one episode of A fib). He was also being treated with olanzapine (Zypreza) and Chlorpromazine for his Alzheimer's, both of which are associated with NMS. However, his initial lab values conflict with those expected in someone with NMS. His CK levels remain normal rather than the expected increase into the 1000's. He does have leukocytosis (WBC 11.6 with ANC 10.7), but that could easily represent infection. It is also common to have elevated LD, Alk Phos and LFT's in NMS, but his remain normal. His only laboratory abnormalities aside from the leukocytosis are a BUN of 37 and a GGT level of 263.  Given his baseline mental state and potential seizure disorder, he is at an increased risk for an aspiration pneumonia. This diagnosis would cause the leukocytosis, fever, 1 day history of rattling cough and would explain the yellowish sputum that was suctioned from his upper airway. Urine and blood cultures x 2 have been drawn to assess for infection. An LP may be considered if nothing grows in his cultures. There is also a possibility that Mr. -- actually has Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) rather than Alzheimer's. After reading through his psych notes, it seems as though he has had a rapid cognitive decline over the past year, during which time he has developed some parkinsonian symptoms (specifically a wide-based, shuffling gait). Additionally, his CNA sitters from Carolina Meadows report that he has ""good days and bad days"" with regard to his cognition. According to UpToDate, Dementia with Lewy bodies is mainly a clinical diagnosis confirmed on autopsy. A progressive cognitive decline is required for diagnosis, and 2 out of 3 of the following make the diagnosis very probable: fluctuating cognition, spontaneous features of parkinsonism which develop shortly after the onset of dementia, and recurrent detailed visual hallucinations. Per psychiatry's notes and the CNA reports, Mr. -- fits these criteria. DLB is also more associated with aggressive behavior (ie head-butting caregivers) than Alzheimer's. This is especially important because DLB is known to cause 1) a severe sensitivity to neuroleptic medications which can mimic the clinical appearance of NMS, and 2) severe autonomic dysfunction. An EKG was performed while on the psych ward when his HR and HTN increased acutely showed significant Q waves in lead III. In his current mental state, Mr. -- would not have been able to report any symptoms of an MI or could have had a silent MI. Cardiac enzymes were ordered, though we must remember that intense muscular contractions like those seen in Mr. --’s rigors and tremors can lyse muscle fibers and also spill CK, CK-MB and even small amounts of Troponin T into the blood stream",,,

He states that the pain began the day before and consisted of a sharp pain that lasted around 30 seconds, followed by a dull pain that would last around 2 minutes. The pain was located over his left chest area somewhat near his shoulder. The onset of pain came while the patient was walking in his home. He did not sit and rest during the pain, but continued to do household chores. Later on in the afternoon he went to the gym where he walked 1 mile on the treadmill, rode the bike for 5 minutes, and swam in the pool. After returning from the gym he did some work out in the yard, cutting back some vines. He did not have any reoccurrences of chest pain while at the gym or later in the evening. The following morning (of his presentation to the ED) he noticed the pain as he was getting out of bed. Once again it was a dull pain, preceded by a short interval of a sharp pain. The patient did experience some tingling in his right arm after the pain ceased. He continued to have several episodes of the pain throughout the morning, so his daughter-in-law decided to take him to the ED around 12:30pm. The painful episodes did not increase in intensity or severity during this time. At the ED the patient was given nitroglycerin, which he claims helped alleviate the pain somewhat. -- has not experienced any shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis during these episodes of pain.

However, we will repeat serial cardiac enzymes at 10pm and again in the morning to monitor for elevation. We will also get another EKG tomorrow morning in order to look for any changes that have taken place since the first one obtained in the ED. ---- will also receive a PA and lateral chest x-ray tomorrow. We will also plan for a nuclear stress test in order to identify any possible coronary causes of chest pain such as unstable angina. 2. h/o HTN We will continue ----’s home medications of Hyzaar 100/25MG QD and Furosemide 20MG QD for control of his blood pressure. Although initially his blood pressure was 147/62, it later stabilized to 108/58. We will advise ---- to follow-up with his PCP for his HTN. 3. Diabetes ---- was recently diagnosed with borderline diabetes and has been trying to control it with diet and exercise. Upon presentation in the ED his blood glucose level was found to be 280. We will place the patient on sliding scale insulin and will continue to monitor his blood sugar levels throughout his stay in the hospital. We will also obtain a hemoglobin A1C to get a sense of what his sugars have been over the past 3 months. We will encourage the pt to follow-up with his PCP about his diabetes since it appears that diet and exercise may have failed, thus requiring a medication to control his diabetes. 4. h/o Sleep apnea ---- has a history of sleep apnea and sleeps with a cpap at home. Throughout his stay in the hospital we will provide him with a cpap at night. 5. FEN ---- will be placed on a diabetic, heart healthy diet.

MI Myocardial infarction occurs when blood supply to the myocardium via coronary arteries is interrupted resulting in ischemia. Risk factors for a MI are atherosclerosis, angina, previous MI or stroke, older age, smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, HTN, obesity, etc. A patient that is having an acute myocardial infarction will typically present with substernal chest pain that may radiate to the shoulder, jaw, or arm as well as SOB, N/V, palpitations, and diaphoresis. On EKG there will be evidence of ST elevation or depression, Q waves, or inverted T waves. Cardiac enzymes such as troponin and CK- MB will typically increase within 3-12 hours after onset of chest pain if the pt is having a MI. A series of 3 measurements of cardiac enzymes is usually performed in order to monitor for elevations over time. All pts who are suspected of having a MI should receive an aspirin as well as nitroglycerin, as was done in the case of ----. ----’s age, diabetes, and HTN put him at an increased risk for a myocardial infarction. His presentation isn’t typical for a MI since his pain is not substernal, there is no N/V, palpitations, sweating, or radiation of pain. His normal EKG and initial normal cardiac enzymes also make it less likely that ---- is currently having a MI. However, it would be ideal to perform another EKG tomorrow morning as well as repeat cardiac enzymes in 6- 8 hours to make sure a MI will not be missed. 2. Angina pectoris /Unstable Angina Angina is chest pain that results from decreased blood flow and ischemia of the myocardium. Pts typically feel pressure, heaviness, or tightness in the chest that is precipitated by exertion or emotional stress. Worsening angina, angina at rest, or angina that lasts more than 15 minutes are all typical signs of unstable angina. A patient with unstable angina does not have ST elevation or new Q waves on EKG and serum CK-MB and troponin are normal. Based upon this information it seems that it is very likely that SR may have unstable angina. His chest pain has not been precipitated by exertion (as with stable angina), but has come on with varying degrees of activity from rest (sitting in bed) to mild exertion (walking around house). Also, once SR was given nitroglycerin in the ED, he stated that his pain had receded somewhat. The only factor in his history that makes the diagnosis of unstable angina less likely is the fact that his chest pain lasts only 2-3 minutes. Typically chest pain associated with unstable angina usually lasts more than 20 minutes in duration. Once SR is stabilized and a myocardial infarction is ruled out he should undergo nuclear stress testing in order to evaluate him for unstable angina. 3. Musculoskeletal pain Musculoskeletal chest pain must be differentiated from potentially life-threatening causes of chest pain such as MI, PE, or aortic dissection. Typically with musculoskeletal pain, the chest pain can be reproduced on physical exam with palpation or with various exercises of the arms and trunk. The patient may also have a history of strength training, yard work, or other exercises that may have strained the chest muscles. Pts with MSK chest pain may benefit from NSAIDS, muscle relaxants, or possibly narcotic analgesics. If all possible cardiac causes of chest pain can be ruled out in the case of ----, his pain will likely be attributed to musculoskeletal. He has a history of exercising at the gym and he also reported doing some yard work after the first episode of chest pain both of which may have lead to chest muscle strain. On physical exam the chest pain was elicited with palpation as well as deep inspiration which also supports a diagnosis of musculoskeletal pain. Therefore, pending negative cardiac enzymes X3, normal EKG X2, and normal nuclear stress test SR can be discharged with the strong suspicion that the source of his pain was muscular. 4. Gastroesophageal reflux A patient with gastroesophageal reflux typically complains of a substernal burning sensation that is most commonly experienced after meals, can wake the patient from sleep, and is relieved with antacids. The chest pain may be described as a squeezing/burning that is located substernally, which may radiate to back, neck, jaw, or arms. Symptoms felt with reflux can thus often mimic angina. A patient with reflux may also experience regurgitation of the gastric contents producing a sour taste in the mouth. This confluence of symptoms does not correlate with what ---- stated that he was experiencing. His chest pain was not substernal nor was it squeezing/burning in nature. He also denied any regurgitation or that the pain was associated with meals. Therefore, I do not believe that ----’s symptoms are due to reflux/GERD. 5. Pericarditis Pericarditis typically presents with chest pain (usually pleuritic), friction rub, and widespread ST segment elevation on EKG. The causes of pericarditis include viral, neoplasm, tuberculosis, prior mediastinal radiation exposure, s/p MI, cardiac surgery or trauma, collagen vascular disease, and drugs. Based upon this information, it does not seem likely that SM has pericarditis. Although he is experiencing chest pain, it does not seem to be pleuritic in nature. No friction rub was heard on physical exam and his EKG was normal. Therefore, a diagnosis of pericarditis is not concerning us at this time. 6. pulmonary embolism Pulmonary embolism is a common and often fatal disease, but the mortality from a PE can be reduced with rapid diagnosis and therapy. A pulmonary embolism typically occurs when a blood clot from a DVT travels to a pulmonary artery (or one of its branches) and obstructs it. Less commonly it can occur from fat or bone (after trauma), air, or amniotic fluid (after childbirth). Risk factors for pulmonary embolism include immobilization, recent surgery, stroke, malignancy, chronic heart disease, and h/o venous thromboembolism. Typically a pulmonary embolism presents with dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, rales, tachycardia, hypotension, S4, and fever. Routine lab findings include leukocytosis, increased ESR, and elevated serum LDH or AST with normal bilirubin, however these findings are all nonspecific for PE. BNP, troponin, and D-Dimer can also be elevated in PE, but elevations in these can also be seen with other disorders as well. The gold standard for diagnosing PE is pulmonary angiography, but spiral CT is increasing in popularity. If hypoxemia exists, the patient should be started on supplemental oxygen. If the patient is hypotensive then IV fluids should be administered. Anticoagulation should also be started as soon as a PE is suspected. Given this description, it is very unlikely that ----’s chest pain is due to a PE. He does not have a history of any of the risk factors listed above. His chest pain does not appear to be pleuritic in nature, he denies shortness of breath or hemoptysis, he is not tachycardic or tachypnic, he is afebrile on exam and his lungs are clear. Therefore, based upon this information, PE is less concerning for us at this time. 7. aortic dissection An aortic dissection occurs when there is a tear in the aortic intima that allows blood to pass into the aortic media, creating a false lumen between the intima and media. A history of HTN is the most important predisposing condition for an aortic dissection. Pts with an aortic dissection typically present with tearing posterior chest and back pain or anterior chest pain. On physical exam there is a pulse deficit resulting in weak or absent carotid, brachial or femoral pulses. There are usually no EKG changes that would indicate ischemia. Chest CT, MRI, or multiplane transesophageal echocardiography can be used for imaging after the patient is stabilized. Cardiac enzymes in an aortic dissection will be negative. Due to this description of an aortic dissection, it seems very unlikely that an aortic dissection is the cause of ----’s chest pain. He is not experiencing a “tearing” chest pain, nor is he complaining of back pain. There were no pulse deficits on physical exam that would support a diagnosis of aortic dissection. Although ---- did not receive any of the imaging studies listed above, he did receive a series of chest radiographs that did not reveal widening of the aorta that is seen in an aortic dissection.",,1. chest pain 2.

Just over 6 months ago the patient was at his normal baseline state of health. Now he has had progressive worsening of his dyspnea on exertion (DOE) to where he cannot walk across a room or talk while sitting up without becoming short of breath; he has never had anything like this before. He rates his breathing troubles as a 7 of 10, with 10 being can’t breathe at all and 1 being normal. He says the breathing troubles are from his lungs/chest and not his nose/congestion. He has had the DOE for ~6 month but progressive worsening in the last 3 weeks. He says the quality of his breathing is just “like suffocating” but he denies burning in his lungs or other feelings. He says that hot temperatures bring on his breathing troubles and coughing while cold temperatures will help relieve those symptoms. Additionally, he has a productive cough with whitish mucus that is not bloody or bilious, and often coughs so hard that he ends up vomiting; he has averaged vomiting once a day over the past few weeks. He has tried Mucinex which made his cough worse and Nyquil to help him get to sleep w/o coughing. He often experiences an aching/burning pain across his whole anterior chest, and sometimes he has more of a tightness in his chest. The chest pain is like bad heartburn. All of his symptoms have always occurred after eating and sometimes without a noticeable trigger. He has had no fevers, chills, or night sweats. He has no allergies, seasonal or otherwise, and no hx of breathing troubles/asthma.

He presented 9 days ago to the UNC ED with the same set of symptoms and had a CT Chest that shows a large right-sided mediastinal mass. LUNG MASS – While the diagnosis is unconfirmed at the moment, it seems likely that this patient has lung cancer. Smoking status is the primary risk factor leading to lung cancer (bronchogenic carcinoma or squamous cell) with a lifetime smoker’s risk being 10- to 30- time that of a non-smoker. Persons with lung cancer are most often (~95%) diagnosed because of some symptom or symptoms. Symptoms may be related to the primary lung lesion or to intrathoracic spread, distant metastasis, or paraneoplastic syndromes. The symptoms most commonly presented include cough, SOB, wheezing, chest pain, hemoptysis, loss of appetite, weight loss, or pneumonia. This patient has a significant smoking hx while exhibiting at least 4 of these symptoms in addition to also having a mass found on imaging studies. Other conditions on the differential for this pt’s lung mass include TB vs aspergillous (fungus ball) vs sarcoidosis vs uncomplicated pneumonia, though the hx has pertinent negatives for much of this differential. The Xrays and CT Chest from last weekend and an additional Xray today show a similar mass. Additionally, a new CT Chest is pending to further evaluate if mass has changed at all. We have scheduled a Bronchoscopy/Biopsy to further workup the tissue/mass. Also ordered is an Induced sputum culture to assess for fungal or bacterial infection. Blood cultures will assess for systemic infection due to pneumonia or some other cause, but this is unlikely due to lack of fevers or other constitutional symptoms. A PPD was placed to be read in 2 days. Despite the lack of TB exposure the pt should be assessed for current TB status. And we will have regular Chem10 and CBC draws to assess for paraneoplastic syndromes including hypercalcemia or resultant hyponatremia (1st set is not suggestive of such); will consider PTH, CEA, and CYFRA 21-1 testing. Also an ACE blood level will be pulled with the AM draw to assess for possible Sarcoidosis, since epidemiologically speaking, the patient is the right age and race for this diagnosis, though it is rare. DYSPNEA ON EXERTION - Likely due to the effect of mass on Right lung, but should consider other concomitant causes such as asthma or CHF. We will watch O2 sats and obtain ""O2 sats on exertion"" for comparison before discharge. Supportive therapy as needed with Albuterol 2.5mg neb q4hr PRN daily and Ipratropium nebs 0.5mg q4hr PRN daily. IF Sat levels go below 92%, apply O2 2 liters nasal cannula. Further workup will be dictated by symptomology. CHEST PAIN/ HEARTBURN/ TIGHTNESS – Quite possible cause by the right sided mass, but these symptoms also required a cardiac workup and GI prophylaxis. EKG and first set of cardiac enzymes were not alarming and the hx does not really fit this kind of pain with such a prolonged course. Telemetry was initiated but has now been pulled. We will draw for two other sets of cardiac enzymes. For now, will give acetaminophen 650 mg PO q6hr pain, with consideration for narcotics if pain persists or worsens. Heartburn prophylaxis with Nexium 40mg PO qhs and sucralfate 1g PO q6hrs PRN qd. COUGHING/VOMITING: Since this patient’s coughing often leads to vomiting (but this is without nausea) it would be helpful to try and prevent the cough. No antiemetic regimen needed. Any foods but soups seem to trigger coughing, so diet with soups and liquids only as tolerated. Also will try Guaifensin 200mg PO q6hr PRN cough. DECREASED PO INTAKE/WEIGHT LOSS: Pt has experienced a 10 lb weight loss and has poor skin turgor. Possible effects of neoplastic disease but also of decreased PO intake and dehydration. Chem10 currently does not show signs of dehydration. Pull again in AM to reassess. Start pt on Mechanical soft diet, which will hopefully be tolerated w/o triggering cough and subsequent vomiting. Start normal saline IV @ 100 ml/hr x 10 hours. Hydrate tonight and reassess volume status. Nutrition c/s for recommendations on patient situation. Thank you for your recommendations. SMOKING Hx/NICOTINE ADDICTION: 20 pack year history. UNC is a non-smoking campus and pt likely to have cravings. Nicotine patch 7mg transdermal qd. EtOH INTAKE: Patient has a consistent intake of about 6-7 beers on weekends, which indicate he may be using the drug in a binge fashion which has been shown to have many negative effects on health. Patient should be educated on how these choices can affect his health. LEUKOCYTOSIS: WBC of 15.1. Despite constitutional signs, infection workup is indicated as already mentioned above. This includes blood cultures, sputum culture, U/A, and urine culture. NO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER: This patient could benefit greatly from having a primary care provider and getting regular physicals and screening for common cancers. Unfortunately there is not a reliable way to screen for lung cancer, but having a PCP still promotes healthier life choices and screening for other conditions. This could include a fasting lipid panel, a check of blood sugars and an A1c, and perhaps a colonoscopy to assess for colonic polyps and cancer. PROPHYLAXIS: Heparin (rectal occult blood was negative and this is for DVT prophylaxis) and Nexium/Sucrulfate (see above) DISPO: Full Code --- Discharge and outpatient followup pending workup of mass and stabilization of dyspnea.

DISPO: d/c tomorrow if pain improves.",,,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder that involves a point mutation in the β-globin gene (Glu6Val). The mutation alters the structure of the hemoglobin molecule (HbS), causing aggregation of hemoglobin under conditions of deoxygenation. Aggregation and polymerization of HbS distorts erythrocyte structure into a “sickle” shape. Sickled cells have a reduced lifespan, resulting in chronic hemolytic anemia. Sickled cells also have an increased propensity to attach to the endothelium of postcapillary venules and cause vascular occlusion. The vascular obstruction and resulting ischemia are responsible for the recurrent episodes of acute pain that are characteristic of sickle cell disease. More life-threatening complications of sickle cell disease include acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestration and aplastic anemia (1). The severe knee pain in the patient is likely secondary a vasoocclusive event leading to periarticular infarction. Microvascular occlusion most often occurs within bone marrow, but can arise in practically any anatomical location. The pathophysiology involves the attachment of sickle cells to endothelium, resulting in the formation of heterocellular aggregates composed of sickle cells, leukocytes and platelets. Vascular occlusion by the heterocellular aggregates results in infarction and the release of inflammatory mediators, which induce pain through activation of nociceptive afferent nerve fibers (2). Management of painful vasoocclusive crises involves hydration, warm packs on the affected areas, and a combination of opioid or nonopioid analgesics and NSAIDs. Painful crises that result in a visit to the ER should be treated promptly with high-dose morphine, as early pain management can decrease the likelihood of costly hospitalization (3). For patients with recurrent vasooclusive events, treatment with hydroxurea has been shown to decrease the rate of pain crises (4). Hydroxyurea has also been shown to cause a modest decrease in mortality for patients with SCD (5). The patient also presented with chronic hypoxia and dyspnea, which are frequent manifestations of chronic lung disease associated with SCD. SCD is frequently associated with pulmonary hyperreactivity, restrict lung disease and pulmonary hypertension (6). A recent study found that approximately 90% adult patients with SCD exhibited abnormal PFT functions, including decreased total lung capacities and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (7). Unfortunately, pulmonary complications of SCD account for 20-30% of the mortality in patients (5). Investigational treatments for the pulmonary complications of SCD include inhalational nitric oxide (NO) and its precursor oral L-arginine. NO induces pulmonary vasodilation, thus alleviating pulmonary hypertension. NO also acts as inhibits expression of cell adhesion molecules involved with binding of sickle cells to endothelium and decreases production of proinflammatory mediators. While transgenic mouse models have suggested a beneficial role of NO and L-arginine for pulmonary complications of SCD, clinical trials are currently lacking (2)."

The last time she used cocaine was approximately 12 hours prior to the onset of her chest pain and SOB. ----’s pain is substernal and she also feels it under the left side of her chest in the midclavicular region; She describes the quality as a chest tightness/pressure without radiation to the shoulder, arm, back, or jaw. It has been a constant pain since it started yesterday evening. At first, she felt a stabbing pain that was 9/10 but eventually it became more “crampy” and is currently 1/10 in the ED after SL Nitro x 2 and ASA (325 mg). She tried Excedrin PM and Tylenol PM at home but it did not help. She also endorses taking 100 mg of Toprol XL yesterday but this also did not alleviate the pain. About 15 min after the chest pain started, she began coughing and endorses having green/brown sputum. The chest pain was not aggravated by coughing or taking deep breaths. Shortly thereafter, ---- became SOB. She felt like she could not catch her breath and got worried so she called 911 and they brought her to the ED.

Moreover, the patient stopped taking her heart failure medicines approximately two days prior to the onset of her C/P and SOB. There is objective evidence from both previous trips to the hospital in July and August that helps rule out MI - cardiac enzymes were WNL and the Adenosine Myoview demonstrated normal myocardial perfusion. ---- is going to be admitted to a Tele bed for overnight observation. She is on 2L of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to ensure that her oxygen sats stay above 92%. We will obtain a 2nd set of cardiac enzymes (CK-MB, Troponin I) 10 hours after presentation at approximately 6:00pm this evening and a repeat EKG will also be performed at this time. We will observe how she responds to the 40 mg of Lasix given in the ED; if her SOB persists, we will consider giving more Lasix. We are also changing her Toprol to Carvedilol because of its additional α-adrenergic antagonism. We fill this is necessary given the patient’s recent cocaine use and the fact that cocaine causes hypertension (via inhibiting norepinephrine uptake and agonizing α-receptors). Will check a BMP and BNP in the AM. We will hold off of any imaging studies or stress tests at this point given that the patient has recently had both an echo and a pharmacologic stress test. We are recommending for her to go back to see her cardiologist at the Heart Failure clinic and to restart her heart failure regimen as soon as gets the finances to refill her prescriptions. 2) Polysubstance abuse: It is critical that ---- stops drinking, smoking, and using cocaine in order to avoid further damage to her heart. Although she has been previously educated about the negative effects of substance abuse with regard to her heart failure, she continues to use. We are requesting a consult with MSW to discuss various drug rehab programs within the community that ---- can access. We will continue with the nicotine patch for smoking cessation and encourage her to stop drinking, smoking, and using cocaine. We have ordered a urine drug screen to document for this particular hospital visit. 3) Nutrition: Rally pack (thiamine, folic acid, MVI, Magnesium Oxide) + Heart Disease Prevention Diet. 4) Prevention: Recommend Pneumovax and Flu shot to avoid illnesses that may exacerbate CHF so that we can avoid future hospitalizations. Of note, ----’s Port-a-Cath from chemotherapy in 2006 is still in place; this is concerning as it is a potential source of infection and other potential complications. We are recommending removal in the outpatient setting and will have to find a way to work around the patient’s financial situation. ---- has been placed on the DVT prophylaxis protocol with SC Heparin because she falls in a higher risk category with her CHF.
